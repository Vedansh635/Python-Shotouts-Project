# Python-Shotouts-Project
Give a personalized shoutout to your friends, family, or colleagues with this Python script! Using the `pyttsx3` library, this program takes a list of names as input and converts them into a spoken shoutout. Simply enter the names separated by spaces, and the script will generate a unique audio message for each one.
